# GrowthModels

  This repository holds the solutions to a general set of growth models that incorporate the following explore the differences between

    * One Agent vs Two Agent
    * One Good vs Two Goods
    * Time Additive Preferences vs Recursive Preferences
    * Constant Volatility vs Stochastic Volatility

  We will identify models in the following fashion (`n`a`n`g[tr][cs]) which will stand for (`n` agents, `n` goods, [time additive or recursive] preferences, [constant or stochastic] volatility). If we wanted to refer to the one agent, one good, recursive preferences with constant volatility model then we would use `(1a1grc)`.
